Mendoza,,NP,Journal,UPLB Institute of Plant Breeding,,"In recent years, worldwide attention has focused on tropical legumes as a possible major source of animal and human food (National Acad. of Sci., 1979; Kay, 1979; National Acad. of Sci., 1975). The publication ""Tropical Legumes: Resources for the Future"" very ably delineated the potentials and problems of these relatively underutilized plants. Although the protein contents of legume seeds are usually high, from 20 to 40%, and higher for a few types, their nutritive values are low due to the limiting sulfur amino acids, cysteine and methionine, and the presence of anti-nutritional factorsÑtrypsin inhibitors, hemagglutinins, flatulence factors, tannins and others. Other toxins may occur in the legumes once, and seeds of these legumes like cyanogenetic glucosides (Conn, 1970), saponins (Applebaum et al., 1970); alkaloids, nonprotein amino acids like mimosine in Leucaena leucocephala. However, these toxins may serve a protective role in the plant against pests and diseases (Applebaum et al., 1970; Hagedorn and Fraps, 1932; Reid and Weber, 1976; Nienstedt, 1953). Many tropical legumes described in the aforementioned books were observed/reported to be relatively resistant to pests and diseases. The role of the toxins in tropical legumes resistance to pests and diseases is not yet well established.",1989,Department Name,,https://www.locjkt.or.id/application/docliblcjkt/upload/Biochemical%20and%20Nutritional%20Studies%20of%20Philippine%20Indigenous%20Food%20and%20Forage%20Legumes.pdf,"Mendoza, E.

Indigenous vegetables are part of traditional Filipino food preparations. They are low-cost, nutritious, and prominent in home gardens and traditional farming systems. However, they are heavily underutilized despite their recognized importance. Some of the reasons include lack of planting materials; lack of information on use, benefits and production; the preferential emphasis on high-value vegetables; and the low preference of some consumers to indigenous vegetables. This initiative aims to address the lack of information materials on indigenous vegetables in the Philippines and raise the awareness of Filipinos on the benefits of the indigenous vegetables.",2023,Department Name,,,"UPLB Institute of Crop Science.
