Biochemical and Nutritional Studies of Philippine Indigenous Foods and Forage Legumes,Emelyn Mae T. Mendoza,,NP,Journal,UPLB Institute of Plant Breeding,,"In recent years, worldwide attention has focused on tropical legumes as a possible major source of animal and human food (National Acad. of Sci., 1979; Kay, 1979; National Acad. of Sci., 1975). The publication ""Tropical Legumes: Resources for the Future"" very ably delineated the potentials and problems of these relatively underutilized plants. Although the protein contents of legume seeds are usually high, from 20 to 40%, and higher for a few types, their nutritive values are low due to the limiting sulfur amino acids, cysteine and methionine, and the presence of anti-nutritional factorsÑtrypsin inhibitors, hemagglutinins, flatulence factors, tannins and others. Other toxins may occur in the legumes once, and seeds of these legumes like cyanogenetic glucosides (Conn, 1970), saponins (Applebaum et al., 1970); alkaloids, nonprotein amino acids like mimosine in Leucaena leucocephala. However, these toxins may serve a protective role in the plant against pests and diseases (Applebaum et al., 1970; Hagedorn and Fraps, 1932; Reid and Weber, 1976; Nienstedt, 1953). Many tropical legumes described in the aforementioned books were observed/reported to be relatively resistant to pests and diseases. The role of the toxins in tropical legumes resistance to pests and diseases is not yet well established.",1989,Department Name,,https://www.locjkt.or.id/application/docliblcjkt/upload/Biochemical%20and%20Nutritional%20Studies%20of%20Philippine%20Indigenous%20Food%20and%20Forage%20Legumes.pdf,"Mendoza, E.

Indigenous vegetables are part of traditional Filipino food preparations. They are low-cost, nutritious, and prominent in home gardens and traditional farming systems. However, they are heavily underutilized despite their recognized importance. Some of the reasons include lack of planting materials; lack of information on use, benefits and production; the preferential emphasis on high-value vegetables; and the low preference of some consumers to indigenous vegetables.

"The need for premium agri-fisheries for the disaster-affected areas of Leyte, Philippines","Dora Fe H. Bernardo, Oscar B. Zamora and Lucille Elna P. de Guzman",,NP,Journal,"1Institute of Biological Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences, University of the Philippines Los Baños, College, Laguna 4031 Philippines; 2Crop Science Cluster, College of Agriculture, University of the Philippines Los Baños, College, Laguna 4031 Philippines",,"The study was conducted in the fish sanctuary in Tolosa, Leyte from May to August 2011. Actual habitat assessment, focus group discussions (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII) among the stakeholders were conducted. Relevant secondary data were obtained from the local government units and NGOs working in the project site on the impacts of land use, particularly siltation or sedimentation and sea surface temperature on the coral reef ecosystem and their effects on the population of crown-of-thorns (COT) starfish were determined. Using the point intercept method, it was found that coral cover of Hilapad Reef Fish Sanctuary or Marine Protected Area (MPA) decreased from 60% live coral in 2005 to 10% in 2011. Factors that caused the coral degradation or destruction were investigated. The natural factor that caused coral degradationthat caused coral degradation is the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) that SST range from 23-30 ?C. There was no coral bleaching due to El Niño events that occurred in the area since more than 30 ?C is required to cause coral mortality. However, SST of 27-28 ?C during midsummer in 2008 significantly triggers the spawning of Crown-of-Thorns (COT) starfish which is a coral predator. It takes two (2) years for COT to become adult. Based on the KII and FGD, COT outbreak was reported in the same year but the COT population was never counted until 2011 when the study was conducted. Likewise, local fishers in the community affirmed that their catch declined since coral reefs are biologically productive habitat; feeding, spawning, breeding, and nursery grounds for marine flora and fauna. The Hilapad Reef was compared with Cuatro Islas, an isolated MPA in the province that was used as the control. Unlike Hilapad Reef, there was no COT outbreak and coral cover was in better condition in Cuatro Islas. Cuatro Islas has no human settlement and agro-industrial development such as beach resorts, houses, coconut plantation, and oil mill with port. Tolosa is prone to erosion based on the geo-hazard map. Rainfall brings river run-off to the sea. Thus, sedimentation or siltation due to land use change was considered as the anthropogenic factor. Human use of coastal zone has increased the nutrients flowing to the sea, resulting to an increase in plantonic food for COT larvae. The water from the oil mill broiler has pH of 11.8, which is lethal to fish and other marine organisms. Based on the 2011 Fish Visual Census, one fish family was no longer found as compared to the 2009 data. FGD and KII were summarized using SWOT analysis. Within the 18-day sampling, the mean density of the COT gathered in the project site was 256 pieces ha-1 with a mean individual weight of 461 g, a value indicating an outbreak. It was proposed that the Philippine Coastal Management Guidebook be reviewed to include climate change or increasing SST and COT predation as indirect and direct factors, respectively.",2015,None,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299369625_The_Need_for_Premium_Agri-fisheries_for_the_Disaster-Affected_Areas_of_Leyte_Philippines,"Bernardo, D.

Nutrient composition and antioxidant property of Philippine indigenous vegetables,Ilda G. Borlongan,,P,Book,"University Research Center 
Central Philippine University",,"This study determined the nutrient profile and the anti-oxidant property of edible portions of 20 indigenous vegetables commonly consumed in the Philippines. The study concludes that most of the vegetables are important sources of carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, minerals and fats. The vegetables contain minerals (Ca, P and Fe) that can supply our daily micronutrient needs and possess an appreciable amount of anti-oxidant activity that can fight against many of the diseases as nutriceuticals. On the dry weight basis, the protein contents of the vegetables range between 18.4 to 35.4 % with okra having the lowest and jute (saluyot) having the highest. The crude fat contents range from 0.11 to 8.5 % with okra having the lowest value and malunggay having the highest For fiber contents, the values range from 6 to 11.5 % with taro (gabi) having the highest value. The digestible carbohydrate (NFE) contents of the vegetables are relatively higher in comparison with other nutrients. They range from 38 to 64%. The highest value is from okra and the least in malunggay and gabi. The ash contents range from 5% to 18 % with kolitis having the highest ash content and cowpea (paayap) and pigeon pea (kadyos) have lowest ash contents. The moisture or water contents of the edible portion are high at (68 to 92.5%) leaving the dry matter 
contents at 7.5 to 32%. Alugbati has the highest moisture content and therefore the lowest dry matter content Cowpea and pigeon pea have the highest dry matter content. On a percent fresh weight basis, cowpea, pigeon pea and malunggay have the highest protein contents while okra and alugbati have the least. Results also reveal that malunggay has the highest crude fat content. Among the leafy vegetable samples, malunggay has the highest fiber content while among the fruit 
or pod samples, kadyos has the highest fiber. The digestible carbohydrates are highest in kamote tops, malunggay and apat-apat among the leafy vegetables while among vegetable pod samples, highest digestible carbohydrates contents are found in kadyos and cowpea. Percent ash or mineral contents are highest in malunggay, kolitis with spine, violet lupo and ampalaya tops. As to the specific minerals, calcium (Ca) contents range from 103 to 2977 mg/10Og dry weight with 
malunggay having the highest and kadyos the least. Phosphorus (P) contents range from 320 to 610 mg/1 OOg dry weight with apat-apat having the highest content. Iron (Fe) contents range from 7.15 to 101 mg/10Og dry weight with jute (saluyot) having the highest value and okra the lowest. The antioxidant properties of the different indigenous vegetables measured as percent free radical 
scavenging activity and total polyphenolics are relatively high. The antioxidant activities of all raw leafy vegetables and okra (75.7 to 92%) are higher than those of the blanched (64 to 83.4%) and boiled (59 to 80.1%) counterparts. This indicates that blanching and boiling greatly influence the loss of antioxidant components in leafy vegetables. Blanching decreases the activity from 5 to 15% 
while boiling decreases the activity by 10 to 25%. For the vegetable pods, no significant differences in anti-oxidant activities are observed in the raw, blanched and boiled samples indicating that blanching and boiling do not affect the anti-oxidant property of these vegetables. Processing affects content activity and bioavailability of bioactive compounds and therefore health promoting capacity of vegetables depends on their processing history. This aspect should be 
strictly considered to obtain the optimum nutriceutical benefits from these vegetables. The findings on the nutriceutical importance of these indigenous vegetables to humans should provide a motivation for exploring their horticultural potential.",2013,None,,,"Borlongan, I.G.

Bamboo shoots as food sources in the Philippines: Status and constraints in production and utilization,1Merdelyn T. Caasi-Lit and 2Dulce Blanca T. Punzalan,,NP,Conference,"1Institute of Plant Breeding, Crop Science Cluster, College of Agriculture, University of the Philippines, Los Baños (UPLB), 4031 College, Laguna, Philippines; 2Filbamboo Exponents Inc. and Crea 8 Innov 8 Marketing.",,"Bamboo biodiversity and conservation in these times of natural and man-made disasters and calamities is very important. The dwindling number of bamboo species in the forests and natural waterways is already unabated. This is coupled with increasing human population that not only continues to contribute to pollution of the environment, but also extract resources, thus natural bamboo groves are disappearing. Because of this, use of bamboo shoots as food source is limited especially where there are no more bamboo stands. This is also the result of its status as a poor man’s timber and a minor forest and natural resource in the past decades. This paper generally aims to disseminate the “back to basics” importance of bamboo and bamboo shoots, campaign for its continued planting and advocate for better appreciation of its use as food especially to a generation that has been alienated from traditional food items. Genetic conservation for this crop species is being promoted not only for food and wellness but also for its vital role in the environment. It specifically presents the status and prospect of bamboo shoots as potential food source in the Philippines. Some unpublished data and observations on shoot characteristics and plantation establishment of some local bamboo species are also presented as well as the economic benefits of bamboo shoot farming based on previous studies. Problems in bamboo shoot R&D, constraints in production and utilization are also enumerated.

Rhizomes are the main source of starch that are easily digested when extracted and produces a dry white powder. This powder is a source of one of the purest form of natural carbohydrates which is considered gluten free and superior quality starch used in making the first class biscuits, pastries, pudding, cakes, native Filipino delicacies and many more. In Marinduque, Philippines arrowroot cookies are one of the most popular “pasalubong” or food products produced from arrowroot starch. For every one kilo of arrowroot rhizomes, starch recovery commonly ranges from 10-20% depending on its quality.

Filipino Kulinarya cuisine and chronic kidney disease,Tessa O. Churillo,,NP,Journal,"University of Virginia Health System, Kidney Center Dialysis, Charlottesville, Virginia.",,"Filipino communities exist in many places around the world. Migration of Filipinos is recorded as early as 1417 during a trade mission to China followed by travel in galleon ships during the Spanish colonization between 1521 and 1898.1 A more organized migration started in the early 1900s through the need for agricultural labor in Hawaii followed by the migration of Filipino veterans who served in the U.S. armed forces after World War II. During the 1970s, the Philippines experienced a significant increase in the unemployment rate resulting in an increase in migration as contract workers went to different countries to seek work.

After each storage period, the bulbs were planted. Results showed that storage duration significantly affected the rate of mortality, days to bulb formation and plant height at harvest but not the number of leaves and bulblets per plant, yield per plot and adjusted yield per hectare. The highest percentage mortality (29.40%) was noted in plants stored for 5 days, the lowest (2.32%) for 65 days. The trend was that mortality decreased as storage duration increased. Results also revealed significant effects of storage duration on number of days to bulb formation, ie, it was fewer under longer storage: 35, 50 and 65 days. It appears that the minimum storage duration is 35 days, while extending the storage duration up to 65 days causes no significant effect on the initiation of bulb formation. Plant height at harvest was significantly lower with longer storage. Data shows that bulbs subjected to long storage formed bulbs earlier and had the lowest height at harvest. However, no significant differences were observed in the number of leaves and bulblets per plant and yield per plot. Though results were not significant, an increasing trend was reflected on the number of bulblets and yield per plot from 5 to 50 days of storage.

This year, about 10,000 segregating seeds were generated through the polycross method for use as a source of variability for drought tolerance. Simultaneously, under glasshouse conditions, local cultivars were screened to identify resistant genotypes. Results 
showed that only two cultivars (Kalbo-oy and Tocano) produced storage roots under drought conditions. These cultivars will be used as checks in screenings for drought resistance.

Protection from this harsh environment can be provided by various means, but there are obvious trade-offs between protection and cost. The practical reality is that there is minimal uptake of protected cropping in the region, and focus group discussions indicated that this was primarily due to the cost of the protective structures. Thus, in the project reported here, economics research, combined with agronomic and engineering, plays a significant role in trying to achieve a cost-effective protected cropping production system. The results of farmer-cooperator trials show that protected cropping can be economically feasible and there is already been uptake beyond the auspices of the project. Farmer skill levels (including crop selection) are important in contributing to productivity and revenue. Also, basic inputs such a fertiliser and pest control are important.

"Water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica, Convolvulaceae) a food gone wild.",Daniel F. Austin,,NP,Journal,"Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, 2021 N. Kinney Road, Tucson, AZ 85743, U.S.A.",,"Water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) has been considered native to Africa, Asia, and the southwestern Pacific Islands. The herbs have been a medicinal vegetable in southern Asia since at least A.D. 300, and perhaps since 200 B.C. People still gather plants from the wild and cultivate them. With European arrival in these regions in the late 1400s, they became aware of this medicinal food and began carrying water spinach around the world. As with other transported plants, Europeans took along some common names and cultural uses. With the later migration of people from Asian countries to other parts of the world, the food was imported into new areas. Doubt persists as to where the species was domesticated. Data from uses as food, regions of cultivation, medicinal use, phylogenetic studies, common names, and pathogens suggest that water spinach was first cultivated in southeastern Asia. The plants may have been domesticated in China and India, but the data are equivocal.

This study determines the consumer preference among three vegetable pasta noodles namely: black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), red bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) and Gynura procumbens or sabungai through an online survey. The survey included eight questions and was conducted through an open access document with 200 respondents. Based on the results, 50% of the respondents opted to have red bell pepper-added pasta noodles. These respondents are also willing to pay Php 100-200 (USD 2-4) for a single serving of pasta. The online survey was followed by a consumer-type sensory evaluation where the plain (no vegetable-added) pasta noodles and the three vegetable-added pasta noodles were evaluated by 50 untrained panellists. The general acceptability of plain and red bell pepper pasta noodles may not be significantly different from each other but the mean scores showed that the plain (no-vegetable added) pasta noodles has the highest acceptability followed by the red bell pepper pasta noodles.

Protection from this harsh environment can be provided by various means, but there are obvious trade-offs between protection and cost. The practical reality is that there is minimal uptake of protected cropping in the region, and focus group discussions indicated that this was primarily due to the cost of the protective structures. Thus, in the project reported here, economics research, combined with agronomic and engineering, plays a significant role in trying to achieve a cost-effective protected cropping production system. The results of farmer-cooperator trials show that protected cropping can be economically feasible and there is already been uptake beyond the auspices of the project. Farmer skill levels (including crop selection) are important in contributing to productivity and revenue. Also, basic inputs such a fertiliser and pest control are important. There is a negative correlation between rainfall and vegetable productivity. As experience is gained by farmers and LGU's in the region, the economic feasibility should be further enhanced.",2018,None,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268302956_Economics_of_Vegetable_Production_Under_Protected_Cropping_Structures_in_the_Eastern_Visayas_Philippines,"Armenia, P.T., Menz, K.M., Rogers,G.S., Gonzaga, Z.C., Gerona, R.G., Tausa, E.R.

Kinney Road, Tucson, AZ 85743, U.S.A.",,"Water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) has been considered native to Africa, Asia, and the southwestern Pacific Islands. The herbs have been a medicinal vegetable in southern Asia since at least A.D. 300, and perhaps since 200 B.C. People still gather plants from the wild and cultivate them. With European arrival in these regions in the late 1400s, they became aware of this medicinal food and began carrying water spinach around the world. As with other transported plants, Europeans took along some common names and cultural uses. With the later migration of people from Asian countries to other parts of the world, the food was imported into new areas. Doubt persists as to where the species was domesticated. Data from uses as food, regions of cultivation, medicinal use, phylogenetic studies, common names, and pathogens suggest that water spinach was first cultivated in southeastern Asia. The plants may have been domesticated in China and India, but the data are equivocal.

A total of 40 informants were interviewed, allowing for Calculated Informant Consensus Factors (ICF), Use Value (UV) and Fidelity Levels (FL) for each medicinal plant species used to cure various ailments. This helped to establish a consensus on which species are effective for a particular ailment, as well as the species’ relative importance, and enabled us to understand the extent of potential utilization of each species. The therapeutic effects of 109 plant species used medicinally against 13 categories of ailments. The highest ICF values were cited for diseases of the eye and adnexa and for genitourinary system.

AVRDC – The World Vegetable Center currently conducts project activities in collaboration with national partners in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan to promote the conservation and use of indigenous vegetables. Project activities focus on the rescue, improved conservation, and seed increase of promising lines, variety trials and participatory evaluation of selected accessions, and training personnel in germplasm management. Priority crops differ from country to country.

"Potential of underutilized traditional vegetables and legume crops to contribute to food and nutritional security, income and more sustainable production systems",Andreas W. Ebert,,NP,Conference,"The World Vegetable Center P.O. Box 42, Shanhua, Tainan, 74199, Taiwan",,"Agriculture is under pressure to produce greater quantities of food, feed and biofuel on limited land resources. Current over-reliance on a handful of major staple crops has inherent agronomic, ecological, nutritional and economic risks and is probably unsustainable in the long run. Wider use of today’s underutilized minor crops provides more options to build temporal and spatial heterogeneity into uniform cropping systems and will enhance resilience to both biotic and abiotic stress. Many traditional vegetables and underutilized legume crops are an essential source of vitamins, micronutrients and protein and, thus, a valuable component to attain nutritional security. Vegetables in general are of considerable commercial value and therefore an important source of household income. Significant research, breeding and development efforts are needed for a range of promising crops to convert existing local landraces into competitive varieties with wide adaptation and promising commercial potential. Access to genetic diversity of these selected crops is a pre-condition for success. Three underutilized minor crops—amaranth, drumstick tree, and mungbean—are highlighted and briefly described.

Biomineralization of calcium oxalate crystals in leaves of Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott (Araceae) in response to herbivory and water regime,Kenneth C. Eco and Beatriz S. Belonias,,P,Journal,"Visayas State University, Visca, Baybay, Leyte",,"Calcium oxalate crystals are common constituents of plant tissues and are believed to play a role in protection against herbivory, calcium regulation and even heavy metal sequestration. In this study, calcium oxalate crystals in leaves of Colocasia esculenta were studied in order to elucidate the biomineralization process of these inorganic components in response to herbivory and different water regimes. Different crystal types occurring in the leaves of C. esculenta were identified, described and quantified in terms of density and distribution. Two general types of calcium oxalate crystals were found, namely: the raphides and druses. The raphides were of two types, the defensive and non- defensive, and both occurred as bundles of elongated crystals enclosed in specialized cells called idioblasts. Druses were spherical conglomerate crystals extensively distributed throughout the leaf. Although degree of herbivory did not significantly affect overall density of calcium oxalate crystals, there was a highly significant interaction effect between herbivory and crystal type. With increasing degree of herbivory from 10% to 30%, the density of druses and non-defensive raphides decreased significantly but that of the defensive type increased. Water availability had a highly significant effect on overall crystal density. Interaction effect between water regime and crystal type was also highly significant. Density of druses significantly increased under waterlogged than non-waterlogged conditions while those of the defensive and non-defensive raphides were unaffected.",2017,None,,,"Eco, K.C. and Belonias, B.S.

Spectrophotometric determination of anthocyanin content in six common vegetables,Ma. Jamica Trexy M. espinosa,,P,Thesis,"The College of Arts and Sciences, Central Philippine University",,"Anthocyanins, the natural colorants that belong to a group of plant compounds called 
flavonoids, are responsible for most of the red, orange, purple, violet, magenta, and blue

specifically imparting the red-violet to purple color which are of interest to the researcher 
are camote (Ipomoea batatas), lupo (Alternanthera sessilis), kolitis (Amaranthus 
tricolor), kadios (Cajanus cajan), balagay (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), and sitaw

content (TAC) from each partic lar vegetable’s part which are the leaves, seedpods, and 
the seeds; and relate them to their anti-oxidant and disease-fighting potentials to benefit 
humankind. Total anthocyanin content in the methanol extracts were analyzed using the 
pH differential method. Spectrophotometric quantitation was used at 520 nm and the 
concentration was expressed as ug/g cyanidin-3-glucoside. Results showed that 4 out of 
these 6 vegetables have positive values for TAC. Balagay has the least TAC (5.68 ± 0.6), 
followed by camote tops (6.57 ± 0.3), sitaw (18.2 ± 0.1), and finally kadios having the

Wili was asked to write a food column for The Manila Chronicle “that would make mouths water.” The couple struck a deal. He would eat and she would write. Doreen began with some trepidation. While she knew how to write, she recalls feeling that she knew nothing about food. A great admirer of M.F.K. Fisher and Waverly Root, she began with restaurant reviews, some of them with Wili, but quickly discovered that food was a key to “the whole cultural package.” Over the course of twenty years, she wrote a series of food columns—“Pot-au-feu” for The Manila Chronicle, “In Good Taste” for Philippine Daily Inquirer, “Foodscape” for Food Magazine, and “Pot Luck” for Mr. and Ms. An erudite and lapidary writer, Doreen had found a way to bring her passion for Philippine food to a wide public. Writing between experience and memory, Doreen discovered in food an accessible point of entry into Philippine culture and history for her readers.

Agricultural biodiversity conservation toward sustainable rice-based farming systems,Vladimir R. Foronda,,NP,Journal,"Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",,"Agricultural biodiversity refers to the natural capital of an agricultural ecosystem, including plants and animals, that sustains key ecological functions, maintain agricultural production and thereby supports food security. Rice ecosystems are an example of agroecosystems that prioritize human needs and perform other ecological roles. To investigate their substantial socio-economic contributions, a case study of the current in-situ rice germplasm, the overall crop-animal landscape, farming practices and local development initiatives was conducted in the province of Camarines Sur, The Philippines. Sixty rice farmers were interviewed in three villages. Sixty-one species belonging to plant families including cereals, vegetables, fruit trees, beverage crops, fiber crops, forestry and agroforestry trees were found growing in the farms. A total of 18 local, improved and hybrid rice cultivars comprised rice germplasm in 2006-2007. In earlier decades, farmers had grown rice landraces, but only one was planted in 2006-2007. In addition to growing crops, 95% of the total farmer-respondents produced livestock while 93% raised poultry, as well. Thus, production of different animal species was an integral part of their economic activities. Innovative farming techniques were adopted by several farmers to favor the existence of diverse domesticated flora and fauna in rice farms. These techniques include seed production of different plant varieties and utilization of farm animal wastes as organic fertilizer. Researchers and officers of academic institutions, national government agencies and civil society organizations reported a range of local development initiatives to facilitate the adoption of appropriate technologies in support of agrobiodiversity conservation and sustainable agriculture. This study highlighted the diverse crop and animal species of rice farms, their important socioeconomic contributions and the potential of rice farms for in-situ conservation of agricultural biodiversity. This study also underscores the need to implement research and development programs to improve genetic conservation of rice, other crops and animals for both ecological and socioeconomic reasons. Thus, capacity development, policy advocacy and institutional partnerships should focus on intensification of sustainable rice-based farming systems to ultimately improve the quality of life of farmers.",2007,None,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301887642_Agricultural_Biodiversity_Conservation_Toward_Sustainable_Rice-based_Farming_Systems,"Foronda, V.R.

"Is Subsistence Enough? Examining the Impact of Household Farm Biodiversity on Dietary Diversity in Bukidnon, Philippines",Christine E. Gonder,,P,Thesis,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana Illinois",,"Hunger and malnutrition have plagued the developing world for decades. Not only are individuals not meeting their daily energy requirements, but individuals are also not meeting their daily micronutrient requirements. Many researchers and health institutions recommend consuming a diverse diet to increase the likelihood of meeting nutritional requirements. In the literature debate exists concerning whether households should focus on increasing income by commercializing and improve their diets by purchasing a more diverse mix of foods, or if households should diversify production at home in order to meet nutritional needs. This thesis uses household data from Bukidnon, Philippines to develop a Production Diversity Score (PDS) that is used to examine the impact of farm biodiversity on an individual’s Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) and the likelihood that individuals are meeting their micronutrient needs. The results suggest that compared to raising production diversity, a more effective route to increasing dietary diversity is to increase income and total expenditures of the household. A relationship appears to exist between children’s diets and production diversity but the relationship is weak and varies with changes in the specification of the econometric model. Results suggest that to increase dietary diversity and the likelihood that individuals are meeting daily dietary needs, households should in fact commercialize and increase their incomes. Moreover, it appears that improvements in infrastructure could have a significant impact on diets in this study area.",2011,None,,,"Gonder, C.E. (2011). Is Subsistence Enough?

Communitybased vegetable production systems: an answer to the food and sanitation crisis of urban poor in the Philippines,R.J. Holmer,,NP,Conference,Periurban Vegetable Project (PUVeP) Xavier University 9000 Cagayan de Oro City Philippines,,"The Philippines are classified among the world’s fastest urbanizing countries. Among the many challenges of this rapid urbanization process is food security. 20% of Filipinos are regularly suffering from hunger and about one third of all children are underweight with iron deficiency anemia and low vitamin A levels. Average per capita vegetable consumption is very low with 40 kg per year. Further, two thirds of all children suffer from intestinal worms due to lack of water and appropriate sanitation facilities at home and in schools. More than 90% of the waste water is untreated and pollutes the water bodies. As a response, several community-based vegetable production projects were established in Cagayan de Oro City, Southern Philippines since 2003. To date, more than 100 poor families are growing vegetables in2community and school-based allotment gardens on family parcels of a size of 300 m each. About 75% of the produce is being sold to outside customers while the remaining 25% are used for own consumption or school-feeding programs. This enabled the participating families to increase their monthly income by about 20%. Each garden is equipped with a compost heap for biodegradable wastes, thus contributing to the local government’s solid waste management program. Further, all gardens are equipped with urine-diverting dehydration toilets which improve the sanitary conditions of the area.

Since promotion of indigenous vegetables is often considered as an avenueto reduce micronutrient malnutrition, special emphasis is placed on analyzing the contributionof this particular food group to household vitamin A and ir on intakes. We use a sampleconsisting of 172 resource-poor households located in peri-urban areas of Laguna Province. A24-hour food consumption recall allows for deta iled, meal-specific examination of diets.Results of the dietary an alysis suggest that fish is of major importance for vitamin A and ironintakes.

In order to determ ine socioeconomic factors influencing vitamin Aand iron intakes, we employ an econometric model, which s hows that deficiencies arestrongly associated with low household inco mes and poverty. Thus, poverty alleviation willhelp reduce the problem of micronutrient malnutrition in the medium and long run. However,in the interim, more targeted interventions will be needed.

Ebert,,P,Conference,"AVRDC – The World Vegetable Center PO Box 42, Shanhua Tainan 74199 Chinese Taipei",,"Climate change and population growth in many developing countries impede progress toward achieving food and nutritional security. Production of an expanded range of food crops can reduce risk and enhance food security. Diversified diets, based on a range of crop species, are essential for nutritional security. Vegetables are an excellent source of vitamins and micronutrients; increasing vegetable consumption can help alleviate malnutrition from imbalanced diets wherever it occurs, in developing countries as well as in developed countries. Vegetables are high value cash crops that generate employment and income, and contribute to gender equity and better livelihoods. Many vegetables - indigenous vegetables in particular - have high levels of micronutrients and could significantly contribute to nutritional security if eaten as part of the daily diet. Many indigenous vegetables adapt easily to degraded soils and to drought-prone, flooded, or saline land, and can be more resilient to extreme climatic events. Despite the importance of indigenous vegetables in combating malnutrition and poverty, and despite the wealth of traditional knowledge about these species, many are still poorly studied and understood by the scientific community. AVRDC – The World Vegetable Center conserves a highly diverse collection of indigenous vegetables, and is engaged in multiplying selected lines of a wide range of crops while conserving their genetic resource base. These indigenous vegetables (e.g. African nightshade, Asian and African eggplant, drumstick tree, bitter gourd, water spinach, amaranth, Chinese kale, edible rape, roselle, Malabar spinach, slippery cabbage, winged bean, and many gourd species) are assessed for agronomic, production, postharvest and nutritional characteristics.

The Nourished Millennium How vegetables put global goals for healthy balanced diets within reach,J.d’A Hughes and J.D.H. Keatinge,,NP,Conference,"AVRDC – The World Vegetable Center PO Box 42, Shanhua, Tainan 74199, Taiwan",,"Those without sufficient food are undernourished and have weakened immune systems; undernourished children may be stunted with impaired cognitive development. More than 70% of malnourished children live in Asia. People unable to consume a balanced diet suffer from micronutrient malnutrition; they may be overnourished, and prone to develop chronic diseases such as anemia, blindness, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. In Asia and the Pacific, almost 600 million malnourished people add a considerable burden to already overstretched healthcare systems. Many nations adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000 and agreed to the time-bound targets (the Millennium Development Goals), yet progress toward these goals 
has been uneven. Some countries in Asia (including Vietnam, Nepal, India, Cambodia, Bangladesh and China) have made significant strides, and Thailand and Sri Lanka have made some progress—however, the challenges to improve child and maternal health and eliminate chronic malnutrition remain, with many rural-urban disparities. Managing global malnutrition is complex, especially with the potential consequences of climate uncertainty and social unrest. While biofortification, food fortification, dietary supplements, and other interventions can improve nutrition, the easiest way to enhance the quality of nutritionally deficient diets is for the poor to grow nutritious foods locally. Vegetables are a key source of micronutrients to improve the health of the malnourished poor, particularly vulnerable women and children. With locally available, high nutrient content vegetables, communities can ensure good nutrition through balanced diets and also increase household incomes. Vegetables such as mungbean, kangkong, moringa, sweet potato leaves and bitter gourd, as well as the more commonly known tomato, onion and cabbage, can provide wholesome and nutritious meals to contribute toward eliminating malnutrition and improving livelihoods amongst the poor.",2012,None,,https://worldveg.tind.io/record/50096/files/eam0421.pdf?version=1,"Hughes Jd’A and Keatinge JDH. 2012.

Grulla",,NP,Research,"Institute of Plant Breeding, Crop Science Cluster, College of Agriculture and Food Science, UP Los Baños, College, Laguna",,"Most often, organic farming focuses on the improvement of management practices such as nutrient application and pest control, and very seldom deals with variety improvement or breeding. Because it has been dependent on commercially-available varieties developed under conventional high-input methods, traits are expressed resulting in low yields that are commonly attributed to organic farming practices rather than to the adaptability of the cultivar to the system. A research program in the Philippines involving several regions and institutions has pioneered in the evaluation and improvement of varieties through breeding under low-input organic conditions. After making several crosses, pedigree selection, replicated yield and on-farm trials, promising and potential varieties were developed and identified in squash, cucumber, lettuce and yardlong bean. The most promising yield advantages over the respective check varieties ranged up to 47% in squash, 31% in yardlong bean, 42% in lettuce, and 43% in cucumber. Pest and disease resistance were also considered during the selection process, and top performers were moderately to highly resistant. General acceptability in appearance, taste and marketability provided additional selection criteria for considering the top performers and potential varieties. Commercial varieties developed and performing well under conventional high-input methods were mostly not suitable under organic low-input conditions.

Garlic Production Guide,V.R. Mamaril,,NP,Article,Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Plant Industry,,"Garlic, Allium stivum L. or bawang is a perennial herb of the Amaryllidaceae family. The plant produces bulb which is surrounded by sheaths and composed of thinshelled bulblets, cloves, or set, all of which are capable of forming a new plant. The bulblet in fresh or in processed form has been used as food, condiment, and for medicinal purposes. Aside from being an indispensable recado (ingredient), garlic is also used to cure athlete?s foot and hypertension. It is used in preparation of drugs, insecticide and explosives.The crop is widely cultivated in the Ilocos, Southern Tagalog and central Luzon regions. All varieties grown in the Philippines are of native origin. These are batangas white, Ilocos white and Batanes white. Garlic is dry season crop because it is harvested during the hot summer months. However, the crop is more productive during cool months when the days are shortest 
since bulb formation occurs at this period.The best soil types for its cultivation are clay alluvial and sandy loam. Cool weather is needed by the crop during its early stage of growth. During ripening stage, a comparative dry soil, dry atmosphere and moderately 
high temperature are important.Areas with an elevation of 8,000 to 1,500 meters above the sea level are good places for cultivation. 
Garlic is a relatively good source of calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Its leaves are sources of protein and of Vitamins A and C. In the Ilocos Region and in many parts of the country, the green tops are used for pinakbet, an Ilocano delicacy.Garlic is 
said to contain antibiotic substances that inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and fungi. People in the rural areas use garlic to treat wounds, toothache, epilepsy, and fungal skin diseases. Scientific experiments in Germany, for instance, have shown that 
certain compounds in garlic block the blood platelets from forming into blood clots, which could cause heart attacks (coronary thrombosis) and strokes.",,None,,https://www.buplant.da.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Garlic-Production-Guide.pdf,"Mamaril, V.R.

To properly meet the aims of the study, the researcher utilized a grounded theory combined with axiomatic approach and descriptive research design to which, the verification used was in-depth interview in semi-structured type given to the eighteen farmers. Corollary, the study revealed that research participants has no formal education but they are able to distinguish the different members of the fern family, and tend to develop indigenous knowledge from the practiced of their ancestors, these lead to Epistemological Perception theorized by the 
researcher that, an indigenous knowledge and informal education is not enough, it must be transformed to scientific facts. As such, the researcher recommends that the local government unit (LGU) of the research environment together with the provincial office of 
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) must come up with a program that will divert indigenous knowledge into scientific facts through formal education. With that collaboration, the rapid growth of ferns in the place will turn to an opportunity to form a new livelihood.

"Contribution of farm products to farmer’s livelihood and household consumption in Leyte, the Philippines",Carol A. Neal,,NP,Journal,"School of Natural and Rural Systems Management, The University of Queensland, Gatton 4343, Australia",,"This paper describes the agroforestry farming systems through which crops, trees and small farm animals are produced and consumed by three farming families on Leyte Island, the Philippines, and the extent to which they contribute to the farmer’s livelihoods and wellbeing. A survey using semi-structured personal interviews was carried out to obtain data on cost savings of farm-grown products consumed, health benefits derived and costs incurred in managing and maintaining each farm. There were notable differences in crop-tree arrangement and management methods used by the farmers. An estimate of the amount of product that was consumed by the households was conditional on crop choices and intensity of effort and inputs and offsets from off-cam income. Informal arrangements for bartering food, and coconut and bamboo product sharing for community use, made precise valuation of these products difficult, but comparative values against local market prices were placed on marketable produce. Labour and other inputs between the farms varied widely, depending on the type of products. In addition to crops grown as a source of income, portions of farm products were grown specifically for home consumption, and some non-consumable products were exchanged between households. The farmers has a basic understanding of the nutritional value and health benefits of all the food products they consumed for daily energy, health and medicinal purposes. They also believed that consuming their own farm-grown produce generated savings compared with quality and value of the same product from the local markets.",2007,None,,,"Neal, C.A. (2007).

Interviews were conducted with 44 female key informants representing 40 households. A total of 69 wild edible plant taxa in 31 plant families were recorded. Informant consensus revealed that many wild food plants are prioritized for their caloric content and dietary structure to complement oftentimes monotonous diets. Some of the recorded edibles were found to be non-native weedy introductions, signs of mechanisms for coping with environmental and socio-cultural changes. Preferences for certain wild edible plants also revealed that non-food factors underlay food choices. Significant factors that influence food knowledge and selection appeared to be household income, acculturation and past experiences of food scarcity. Further studies, however, have yet to provide concrete evidence that there is erosion of traditional knowledge. Regardless, determining informant confidence in selecting wild food plants has emphasized that preferences are decided based on socio-economic, cultural and ecological conditions.",2017,None,,,"Ong, H.G. and Kim, Y-D.

Prior to 2008, food imports such as rice were cheap, causing government bureaucrats to harbor the belief that it was more cost-efficient to import than to invest in propping up the production of essential food items. When international food prices hit their peak in 2008, rice — the staple food of Filipinos — became much more expensive. The price of imported milled rice went up 3 times, from a low of about US$400 per metric ton sometime in late 2007 to $1,100 per ton by the time the Philippines entered the rice market and bought more than two million tons in 2008.",2012,None,,https://www.rappler.com/moveph/15156-aiming-for-food-security-in-the-metro/,"Ordinario, M.C.U.

A viable agricultural solution to this problem is the practice of diversified and integrated farming systems (DIFS). For centuries, farming communities have painstakingly developed resilient and bountiful agricultural systems based on biodiversity and on their knowledge of how to work with them in equally complex biophysical and sociocultural settings. One of the most stable, productive and profitable diversified cropping systems in the Philippines is the coconut-based multi-storey system developed and practiced in Cavite. Other examples are organic farming as practiced by small-scale farmers, the bio-intensive gardening promoted by the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction in Cavite, the sloping agricultural land technology promoted by the Mindanao Baptist Rural Life Center in Davao del Sur, the vegetable-agroforestry systems of the World Agroforestry Center in Bukidnon, and the complex upland food-production systems of different indigenous peoples’ communities all over the country.

The acceptability and nutritional content of the fiddlehead fern as extender to bread products in Mindanao Philippines 9000,Marilyn C. Rayon and Sofia C. Naelga,,NP,Journal,"Mindanao University of Science and Technology, Lapasan, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines",,"Ferns are plants that grow on the mountains and are usually used for landscaping and flower arrangements. Yet, there are varieties of ferns that are edible and are highly nutritious. One example is fiddlehead fern (commonly known in the Philippines as pako). This type of vegetable is commonly seen in the wet markets especially in provinces with its scientific name, Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Swartz. These are usually grown from rhizomes and are found growing on the banks of streams, rivers or other sources of fresh water. Fiddlehead fern can be eaten boiled or stir-fried and is usually mixed with vinegar and tomatoes or other salad dressing. Studies show that ferns are rich in vitamins A and C and are rich in niacin, magnesium, calcium, potassium and phosphorus (Buhusay et al., 2011).This study aimed to create and produce a unique bread recipe product where the fiddlehead fern or pako is used to increase its bulk and enhance the nutritional value of the hot bread. The fern is not only very affordable but most importantly suitable for people who have osteoporosis and other nutrient concern, anemia and diabetes and for children.

Some Familiar Philippine Palms that Produce High Food Value and Tikog,Research Information Series on Ecosystems (RISE),,NP,Research,Research Information Series on Ecosystems (RISE),,"Aside from forest trees that we usually feature in RISE, there are other plant species that can be propagated for economic and environmental benefits. Among such plants are palms and tikog. Palms are minor forest products that abundantly grow in our forests. They have numerous economic uses and are known to provide edible fruits and shoots, buds, alcohol, starch, sugar, oils, fibers, raw materials for furniture making, handicraft, house construction, ornamental and other uses. Ornamental palms are planted mostly in school campuses, resorts, buildings and hotel parks, and along highways. Palms are also used in jigsaw and flowers and serve as good landscape materials for home gardens. This compilation of RISE serves as a guide for our readers/end-users in their quest for information on the characteristics of this palm tree, economic uses and usefulness as an ornamental plant. Nine palm species were included in this issue. Tikog is a multipurpose species that grows in marshlands in the Philippines. Its stalks can be made into mats, handbags, placemats, baskets, tobacco cases and other novelty items as well as materials.

Global trade patterns in fruits and vegetables challenges and opportunities,Rudyard R.

Not only has world trade in fruits and vegetables gained prominence, but the variety of commodities has expanded. Over the years, three regions-the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) area, and Asia (East, Southeast, and South)-have remained as both the major destinations and sources of supply. A substantial share of their trade is intraregional, particularly that of the EU. All the three regions, however, depend on Southern Hemisphere countries for imports of juices and off-season fresh fruits, and on equatorial regions for bananas, the leading fresh fruit import.

Mayor,,NP,Article,"University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines",,"Objective: To assess the antioxidant activity of Ficus pseudopalma Blanco (Moraceae) (F. pseudopalma) and characterize the active components present in it. 

Methods: Column chromatography of crude ethanol leaf extract of F. pseudopalma was performed and seven fractions were obtained, labeled as F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7. DPPH, FRAP, Griess, Fenton and superoxide radical scavenging assays were performed to assess the antioxidant ability of the fractions. Thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed to identify and characterize the bioactive component present in each fractions of F. pseudopalma. 

Results: DPPH and FRAP assay showed that F5, F6 and F7 exhibited the good proton accepting ability and reducing power as compared to the other fractions. All fractions exhibited a good nitric oxide radical scavenging activity wherein F1, F2 and F3 showed the highest inhibition. However, all of the fractions exhibited a stimulatory activity on hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. Lupeol matched one of the spots on the thin layer chromatography chromatogram of the fractions. Linear gradient high performance liquid chromatography and spiking of lupeol with the fraction revealed the presence of 5.84 mg/L lupeol in F6. Infrared spectra of the fractions revealed the presence of C-C, OH, aromatic C=C and C=O groups.

How to Succeed Exotic Vegetables Spices and Herbs,Sølvi Svendsen,,NP,Book,Det Norske Hageselskap,,"For several reasons, the demand for exotic vegetables, spices and herbs is increasing. One reason is the growing number of immigrants coming to Norway. There are approximately 800,000 persons with an immigrant background from about 200 different countries in Norway. These can be divided into five to seven groups based on different food traditions. Due to this development, there is increasing demand for international foods. Nowadays, Norwegians are travelling abroad much more than before. As a result, they are becoming acquainted with new food traditions from all over the world, and are increasingly looking to find these 
foods on the domestic market, as well. New eating habits and improved storage technology are a third reason for the increased demand for exotic produce. With stores offering a wider range of products and storage methods becoming better, fresh produce is now available throughout most of the year. Traditional preservation methods like canning, drying and salting have been widely replaced by cold storage with advanced temperature and moisture control. Today, food from around the world is imported much faster than before, and is kept under optimal temperature and moisture conditions during transport. Certain exotic vegetables can now be purchased in food stores, but their quality varies due to long transports, in spite of refrigeration. Several of these crops can be grown in Norway (Fig. 1), especially numerous leafy greens and root vegetables. Some of them are also frost-hardy and can be kept outdoors until late fall or early winter.",2014,None,,,"Svendsen, S. (2014). How to Succeed - Exotic Vegetables, Spices and Herbs.

Using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, the total phenolic contents were found to be 93.89 and 85.13 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g extract for ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively and 100.18 and 90.80 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g extract for ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively.

An Ethnobotanical Study of the Plant Biodiversity of Mt Mayon Bicol Peninsula Albay Philippines,"Buot, I.E. Jr.",,NP,Article,Journal of nature studies. Vol. 8 No.1,,"A total of 71 woody species belonging to 49 genera and 33 families are recorded along the altitudinal range of 500-2200 meters above sea level on the northwestern side of Mt. Mayon, Bicol Peninsula, Albay, Philippines. Ethnobotanical uses are diverse ranging from being medicinal, food, timber, firewood, ornamental, sources of fibers, industrial compounds to being poisonous. Thirty-two percent of the species are endemics while the rest are indigenous showing greatest development in the Malesian phytogeographical region. Endemism is very high despite volcanic activity and extensive anthropogenic disturbances such as slash and burn farming and overharvesting of plant biota for sale to domestic tourists. There is an urgent need to determine the biochemical basis for the identified uses of Mt. Mayon plants as this may pave the way to drug discovery and hence, economic development of the locality. An effective domestication program of Mt. Mayon plant biodiversity involving the surrounding local communities could be practical and convenient for everyone and favors protection of the entire Mt Mayon ecosystem and any other forests for that matter.",2009,None,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236340051_An_ethnobotanical_study_of_the_plant_biodiversity_of_Mt_Mayon_Bicol_Peninsula_Albay_Philippines,"Buot, I.E.
